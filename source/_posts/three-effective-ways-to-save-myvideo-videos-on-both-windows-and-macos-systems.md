## Three Effective Ways to Save MyVideo Videos on Both Windows & macOS Systems

### Overview

MyVideo is a German video hosting website on which users can enjoy many splended broadcast videos, live videos, full episodes, and TV programs. However, many users report that video buffering often happens when they watch MyVideo video. And there are also some other users who report that 'this video is not available in your country' issue happens after they open the video to play. Actually, the above two problems can be easily solved if users donwload the MyVideo videos for offline playback. Now the following article just introduces three methods (three MyVideo downloaders) to help users to download their needed MyVideo videos.
