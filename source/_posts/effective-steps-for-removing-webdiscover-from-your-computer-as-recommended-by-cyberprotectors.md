## What is WebDiscover Browser?

WebDiscover browser is a modified version of Chromium browser that pretends to be a secure, privacy-focussed browser. In reality, it displays irrelevant ads and redirects users to malicious webpages while browsing. It also promotes a fake search engine – safestsearches.com. The reason it is a fake search engine because it cannot generate its own search results; instead, it redirects the user’s search queries to Bing.com.

Most users’ do not install it willingly on their system, which is why WebDiscover browser is categorized under [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Many users do not find anything suspicious in it and keep using it, thinking of it as the latest version of Chromium or Chrome browser.

As already mentioned, it can also create havoc by bombarding you with irrelevant ads and redirecting you to the dubious search engine.
