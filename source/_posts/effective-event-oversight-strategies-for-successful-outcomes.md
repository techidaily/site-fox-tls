## Published Events

This type of control events can be published at the discretion of a user by interacting with a button or checkbox on a dialog box.

### Execute custom action - DoAction

This event notifies the installer to execute a custom action. For the _Argument_ field it can use the name of the custom action to be executed.

### Set installer property value - SetProperty

Its syntax is different compared to other control events, instead of the event name it uses the property in square brackets:\[property\_name\]. For the_Argument_ field it can use a [formatted value](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) or{} for a null value.

Here are some examples for this control event:

[MY_PROPERTY]          My Value                AI_INSTALL

### Restart processes using your installation files - RmShutdownAndRestart

* the operating system running the installation is not Windows Vista or above

![Note](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageNote.svg)If no directory has been selected in the DirectoryList control, a DirectoryListOpen event disables any other controls that publish a similar event.

### Open parent directory in a DirectoryList control - DirectoryListUp

This event notifies the DirectoryList control (like the one in "BrowseDlg") that the user wants to select the present directory's parent. This event does not use an argument.
