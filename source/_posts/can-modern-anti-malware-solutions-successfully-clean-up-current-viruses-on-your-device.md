Most antivirus programs come with a pre-installation virus scan feature. Think of this feature as your digital knight in shining armor, guarding your computer during the antivirus installation process. Its primary mission is to ensure that the directory files of the antivirus software remain undefiled before they can locate and annihilate the lurking virus. This process is akin to having a security check before entering a highly secure facility. Cool, isn’t it?

## Does Antivirus Software remove Existing Viruses?

In essence, an antivirus software is akin to your computer’s personal sleuth. It employs signature-based detection and behavioral analysis to identify potential threats.  
  
**Signature-based Detection**: In this process, the program matches each file on your computer with an extensive database of virus definitions (an archive of all known past and current virus infections). If a file corresponds with a virus in the database, it’s flagged as a threat. 

**Behavioral Analysis**: This process is your digital watchman. The program scrutinizes the behavior of files and programs. If a file or program begins to behave anomalously (like attempting to modify system host files or any kind of suspicious activity), it’s tagged as a potential threat.

For additional insights on the intricacies of threat detection, check out our guide on [How Antivirus Works](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).  
  
Remember, **an antivirus can remove an existing virus**, irrespective of whether the infection occurred a day ago or several months back.

## Can a Computer Virus bypass Antivirus?

It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but some virus can indeed circumvent antivirus software. The cybersecurity landscape is essentially a relentless cat-and-mouse chase between cybercriminals and cybersecurity firms. The villains are always concocting new strains of malware, while the heroes tirelessly enhance their defenses.

But how does a virus sneak past antivirus software? Here’s the clandestine trick: it’s all about timing. When a new virus is unleashed into the digital world, there’s a short period – known as [zero-day](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) – during which the antivirus software is oblivious to it. During this window, the virus can cause significant damage.

**Does this mean antivirus software is useless?** Absolutely not! It is your primary defense against a myriad of cyber threats. While it might not catch every single new virus, it’s an indispensable tool in safeguarding your digital security.

## Is Antivirus 100% effective against Malware?

In a utopian world, your antivirus would be impervious to any threat. But the reality is, no antivirus can provide absolute protection. They are an integral component of your cybersecurity strategy, but they are not invincible. 

Why is this the case? Because the cyber threat landscape is perpetually mutating. New malware is being concocted at a terrifying pace, and cybercriminals are persistently devising ingenious methods to bypass security measures.

Despite this, having an antivirus is far superior to not having one at all. It will shield you from known threats and can significantly minimize your risk of infection. Moreover, most antivirus software now comes with additional features like phishing protection and secure browsing tools.

Remember, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. While antivirus software should shoulder the bulk of the burden, you also need to adopt safe online practices. This includes keeping your software updated, [using robust, unique passwords](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), and exercising caution with suspicious emails or websites.
