### Method One: Purchase the eMusic music

If you have purchased one eMusic album or track you can choose to download your purchased eMusic album or track upon purchasing by clicking "download now" option or download later by clicking "My Music" option. In this way you will get the downloaded eMusic album in a .zip file or get the downloaded eMusic album tracks in a 320KB MP3 file.

This way can satisfy most of users who only want to offline listening to eMusic music on MP3-supported devices or media players. But there are still a small part of users who expect to download eMusic music to WAV, AAC, M4B, WMA, AC3, AIFF, OGG, etc for more other devices or having some other uses. For these users, I think the following Way Two will be more appropriate.
