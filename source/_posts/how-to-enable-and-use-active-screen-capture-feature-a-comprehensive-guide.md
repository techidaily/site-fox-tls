 Main Action! application window will hide and Action! will switch to desktop region recording view. Use mouse to adjust your region size and position. You can precisely control region size and position with keyboard: use **arrows** to move region, use **SHIFT + arrows** to resize region.

 Green region frame indicates that region is accepted and Action! is ready to start recording. Gray frame indicates that current region cannot be recorded. Region cannot be recorded when it includes area of 2 different desktops.
