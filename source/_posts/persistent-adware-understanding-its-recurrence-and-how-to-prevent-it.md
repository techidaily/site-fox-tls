## Persistent Adware: Understanding Its Recurrence and How to Prevent It

[Adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is a type of malware program, which is more of a nuisance than a threat. The term adware is a combination of **Advertisement + Software**. It refers to the software or applications that display unwanted, unintentional ads on the screen while users are browsing the internet or running an application. Adware can display ads even on legitimate websites and apps that generally do not show ads to the users. That’s why it comes under [Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

After continuously getting ads on their browsers, many users just reset them in the hope of getting rid of ads. But in maximum cases, only resetting the system does not work, and adware keeps coming back. Even just uninstalling the ad-causing application won’t work many times.

In this post, we will discuss why adware keeps coming back even after resetting the browser and how to solve this problem.

## What are the signs of Adware infection?

When your system gets infected with an adware program, it will show certain signs that confirm the infection. Here are the top indications of an adware infiltration:

* For remaining active in the background, the adware will continuously consume the system power, thereby significantly slowing down the computer and affecting the running of other legitimate apps.
* Likewise, to bombard ads continuously, adware programs require good internet bandwidth. This will highly slow down your internet speed while downloading and even browsing.
* While browsing the internet, you will be bombarded with irrelevant advertisements. Mostly, the ads will be in the form of popups and banners. You will see ads even on legitimate sites that usually do not display any ads.
* If you are redirected to random websites without your intervention, it might be the work of adware. An adware can hijack the browser and control its settings for ad bombardment.
* You might notice some random applications installed on your system that you don’t remember installing.

## Why Adware comes back?

After getting hit by continuous irrelevant ads, you might get irritated and reset your browser settings to their default. However, you have to understand that it is not the browser that is responsible for the advertisements. Browser is just the medium to display the ads. The real culprits are the adware apps or [web extensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Here are the reasons why adware keeps coming back:

* The culprit Adware is still present in the form of an app or web extension. So unless you remove it entirely from the system, you will keep gettings ads.
* When you have taken the backup of your system, you might have accidentally backed up the ad generating application too. So, every time you restore that backup, the Adware also comes back with other things.
* You might have removed the adware manually. However, this only provides momentary relief. The ad-causing files might be present deep in the system, which can reactivate the adware even if you have removed it. To completely remove adware from the device, you require dedicated adware or malware eliminating programs that are specifically designed to scan and find out every malicious file from every corner of the system and eliminate them.
* The adware keeps coming back if you keep accessing the malicious source even after removing the culprit application. The source could be anything like an unknown email, a malicious website, a USB drive, and more. If you knowingly or unknowingly reach these sources, you might reactivate the adware, and it comes back.
* Adware might also come back if you re-install the bundled program through which it came before.
* Every time you re-install the infected programs and games downloaded from illicit sources like unknown third-party websites or torrents, you reintroduce adware along with them.

## How do I permanently remove Adware?

If you are tired of removing the Adware, but it keeps coming back, it might be hiding deep inside your system files. You have to try eliminating it from the root to get rid of it completely. To do that, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Switch over the PC to Safe mode**

Safe mode is a special way to predict the system-critical problem, which interrupts the normal operation of Windows. So, safe mode is an alternate boot method that makes it easier to diagnose adware and malware infection. There are minimum programs and services in Safe Mode

So, if any adware started to load automatically into your PC, it will remove the files which are not running or active. Let’s see the steps to [switch over your PC to Safe Mode](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/).

* For this, Login into your Windows PC and click the “start” button and tap the “Power” Hold on the Shift key, and select _“Reboot”._
* From the full-screen menu, select the _“troubleshooting”_ and then the _“Advanced Options”,_ then opt for _“Startup Settings”._ So, once getting into the Startup Settings screen, tap the _“restart”_ button from the list of settings options.
* Next, you’ll see the window with numbered options, which is hinted as _“press a number to choose from the options below”_. You can select number _“4” (Enable Safe mode)_ to enter into the Safe Mode.

After entering into the Safe Mode, you may find that your system runs faster, and then this is all because of the malware infection. Still, the malware persists in your PC, then follow the upcoming methods.

### **Step 2: Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. You should delete all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free up valuable space.

### **Step 5: Reset Web Browser Settings**

**Browsers are the Gateway for Malware like Adware, browser hijackers, and others.**  An adware will enter your system in many ways, but most browsers are the gateway for them. There is definitely a risk involved when you download a file from unofficial websites or an attachment from an unsolicited email. Along with that, security vulnerabilities in the web browser programs themselves might sometimes lead to malware exploit.

It is best to reset the browser to its original state after an adware infection. Here are the ways to reset different web browsers.
